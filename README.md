# ML_Covid_Detection
Based on patients answers and the results of real covid-19 test we would like to establish which combination of symptoms will tell us that someone has corona or not. Our hypothesis is that there is link between symptoms data and the result of real covid-19 test and there is a way to calculate that value.
